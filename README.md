University of Oregon - Computer Information Technology 282
Final Project
Drew Lesh

This project was up to my choice, so long as it followed guidelines such as:
- Uses multiple Rest API's to gather and ouput data on the web server
- Has multiple data entry forms
- Has more than 3 Reat controlled HTML elements
- Has a Parent Component with many state variables and multiple Children that lift state variables
back to the Parent Component
- Fetch data in a useEffect hook to load data
- Data fetched is listed through the web page
- At least one interactive graph(bar chart to visualize nutritional values of each recipe in my case)
